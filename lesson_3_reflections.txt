fSo why would I want a remote repository?

What if my house burns down? Or my computer explodes!
Of course I may just want to use more than one computer.
Or share my work.
Or let other people contribute. 

There are plenty of reasons. Plenty.

Why would I want to selectively  pull?

Pulling down automatically may overwrite code on my local machine that is WIP.
