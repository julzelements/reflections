So why would I want a remote repository?

What if my house burns down? Or my computer explodes!
Of course I may just want to use more than one computer.
Or share my work.
Or let other people contribute. 

There are plenty of reasons. Plenty.

Why would I want to selectively  pull?

Pulling down automatically may overwrite code on my local machine that is WIP.

Okay- forks clones and branches

Lets say I want to use a swift library i found with a few tweaks added.
But I also want to tweak that library with my fellow project collaborators
That's a perfect job for FORK!

Clones is when I want to pull that modded library down into my project locally and compile

Branches. Well we use branches for trying new ideas mostly.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote locally?
You can work offline and know that you are up to date.
